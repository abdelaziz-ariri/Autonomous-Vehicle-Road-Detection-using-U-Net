# Autonomous-Vehicle-Road-Detection-using-U-Net
This project implements a **real-time semantic segmentation system** for **autonomous vehicle road detection** using the **U-Net deep learning architecture**.   The model performs **pixel-wise classification** to identify key urban elements such as roads, sidewalks, vehicles, pedestrians, and infrastructure from driving videos.
